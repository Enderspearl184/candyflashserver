# candyflashserver

This used to run on a glitch.com project, allowing the discontinued flash version of Candy Crush Saga to be played again.
The code is quite bad becuase it was a hacked together prototype -- I used the knowledge gained from this to [curate the game](https://fpfss.unstable.life/web/submission/115296) for 
[Flashpoint Archive](https://flashpointarchive.org/) (which is far more stable!)
